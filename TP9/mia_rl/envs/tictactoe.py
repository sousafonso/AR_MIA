    Conventions:
    - Player X always goes first (represented as +1 in the board).
    - Player O is represented as -1.
    - `current_player` alternates between 1 (X) and -1 (O) each step.
    - The state is a length-9 tuple representing all 9 cells row-major:
        indices  0 1 2
                 3 4 5
                 6 7 8
    - `step()` applies the current player's move, then switches turns.
    - Episode ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw).
    - Rewards from the perspective of the player who just moved:
        +1  for winning
        -1  for losing (opponent wins — not possible in one step, included for completeness)
         0  otherwise (ongoing or draw)

    For self-play, call `reset()` at the start of each game and alternate
    calling `step()` for player X and player O.
