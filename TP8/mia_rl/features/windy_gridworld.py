# ── Tile-coding features for semi-gradient SARSA control ────────────────────
# Tile coding uses LOCAL, OVERLAPPING binary features:
# each "tile" is active for a small neighbourhood of states, so a weight
# update only changes Q-values for a few nearby states rather than
# propagating globally.  This matches the approach recommended in
# Sutton & Barto Chapter 9 for linear function approximation on grid tasks.
#
# Setup (default 7×10 grid):
#   4 tilings, each with 2×2 tiles, offset by (dr, dc) ∈ {0,1}²
#   Tiles per tiling : ceil((7+1)/2) × ceil((10+1)/2) = 4 × 6 = 24
#   State feature dim:  4 × 24 = 96
#   Action feature dim: 96 × 4 actions = 384   (action-specific block encoding)
#
# Each feature is scaled by 1/N_TILINGS (= 0.25) so that the sum of active
# features is always 1 — this keeps the effective step size constant regardless
# of alpha.
